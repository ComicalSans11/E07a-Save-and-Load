# E07a-Save-and-Load    

We learned how to create save and load states, using a number adder and subtractor, and saving and loading various different numbers. We stored a final value of -3 for the sake of the assignment. Use the plus and minus symbols to add or subtract 1 from the value, and use save and load to save and load the values.
